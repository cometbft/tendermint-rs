[Tendermint] in Rust with [TLA+ specifications](/docs/spec).

Tendermint is a high-performance blockchain consensus engine for Byzantine fault
tolerant applications written in any programming language.

## Requirements

Tested against the latest stable version of Rust. May work with older versions.

## Versioning

Each of the following branches targets a specific version of [Tendermint
Core][Tendermint]:

| tendermint-rs branch | tendermint-rs version | Tendermint version |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| `master`             | v0.24.x               | v0.35.x            |
| `v0.23.x`            | v0.23.x               | v0.34.x            |

We will do our best to support one version behind the latest official release of
Tendermint Core (e.g. if v0.35.x is the latest release, we will aim to support
v0.34.x as well).

### Semantic Versioning

We do our best to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). However, as
we are pre-v1.0.0, we use the MINOR version to refer to breaking changes and the
PATCH version for features, improvements, and fixes.

We use the same version for all crates and release them collectively.

If you are using the v0.23.x series of tendermint-rs, however, **please pin your
dependencies to a specific patch version**. We may need to introduce breaking
changes to this series in patches (e.g. if critical security updates require
it), but we will do our best to avoid doing so.

## Documentation

See each component for the relevant documentation.

Libraries:

- [tendermint](./tendermint) - Tendermint data structures and serialization
- [tendermint-abci](./abci) - A lightweight, low-level framework for building
  Tendermint ABCI applications in Rust
- [tendermint-light-client](./light-client) - Tendermint light client library
  for verifying signed headers, tracking validator set changes, and detecting
  forks
- [tendermint-light-client-js](./light-client-js) - Low-level WASM interface for
  interacting with the Tendermint light client verification functionality
- [tendermint-p2p](./p2p) - At present this primarily provides the ability to
  connect to Tendermint nodes via Tendermint's [secret
  connection](tendermint-secret-conn).
- [tendermint-proto](./proto) - Protobuf data structures (generated using Prost)
  for wire-level interaction with Tendermint
- [tendermint-rpc](./rpc) - Tendermint RPC client and response types
