## Versioning

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). However, as we are
pre-v1.0.0, we use the MINOR version to refer to breaking changes and the PATCH
version for features, improvements, and fixes.

Only the following crates are covered by SemVer guarantees:

- tendermint
- tendermint-rpc

Other crates may change arbitrarily with every release for now.

We use the same version for all crates and release them collectively.
