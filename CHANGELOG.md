## Unreleased

- Start using model-based testing for Light Client ([#414])
- Add testgen tester to factor out test execution from integration tests ([#524])
- Add spec for the light client attack evidence handling ([#526])
- Return RFC6962 hash for empty merkle tree ([#498])
- The `tendermint`, `tendermint-rpc`, and `tendermint-light-client` crates now compile to WASM on the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` and `wasm32-wasi` targets ([#463])
- Dependency update: sled 0.34 ([#490])

### BREAKING CHANGES:

- `[rpc]` The entire RPC client interface has been refactored. The
  `Client` struct has now been replaced by an `HttpClient` struct, which
  implements all of the RPC methods except those relating to event
  subscription. To access this struct, you now need to enable both the
  `client` and `transport_http` features when using the `tendermint-rpc`
  crate. ([#516])
- `[tendermint]` Removed Amino types. All types are now `DomainType`s
  implementing Protobuf-encoding using Prost. ([#504], [#535], [#536],
  [#585])
- `[tendermint]` Changed validator sorting order to sort by voting power
  (descending) and address (ascending). ([#506])

### IMPROVEMENTS:

- `[rpc]` A `WebSocketClient` is now provided to facilitate event
  subscription for a limited range of RPC events over a WebSocket connection.
  See the [Tendermint `/subscribe` endpoint's](https://docs.tendermint.com/master/rpc/#/Websocket/subscribe)
  and the `tendermint-rpc` crate's docs for more details.
  To access this struct you need to enable both the `client`, `subscription`
  and `transport_websocket` features when using the `tendermint-rpc` crate.
  ([#516])
- `[rpc]` A `MockClient` and `MockSubscriptionClient` struct are available for use in
  instances where you may want to interact with the Tendermint RPC from your
  tests without integrating with an actual node. To access these structs you
  need to enable the `client`, `subscription` and `transport_mock` features
  when using the `tendermint-rpc` crate. If you only want to use the
  `MockClient` struct, just enable features `client` and `transport_mock`.
  See the crate docs for more details.
  ([#516])
- `[rpc]` The subscription client interface provides a structured `Query`
  mechanism to help ensure compile-time validity of subscription queries.
  See the crate docs and [#584] for details.
- `[rpc]` The RPC request and response types' fields are now all publicly
  accessible ([#636]).

## v0.16.0

*Aug 31, 2020*

This release is the first release of the [testgen][testgen-dir] utility, 
a generator for Tendermint types for unit and integration tests and for model-based testing. 
It is a utility for producing tendermint datastructures from minimal input, targeted for testing.

The release also contains various Rust API-breaking changes. It remains compatible with v0.33 of Tendermint Core.

 ⚠️ ️Deprecation warning ⚠️ : The `lite` module was removed. Please take a look at the [light-client][light-client-dir] crate.

### BREAKING CHANGES:

- [repo] CHANGES.md renamed to CHANGELOG.md
- [tendermint] Eliminate use of `signatory` wrapper crate in favour of underlying `ed25519-dalek` and `k256` crates. `ed25519-dalek` is now v1.0 and `k256` provides a pure Rust implementation of secp256k1 rather than wrapping the C library ([#522])
- [tendermint] Remove `lite` and `lite_impl` modules. See the new `light-client`
  crate ([#500])

### FEATURES:

- [tendermint/proto] A tendermint-proto crate was created that contains the Rust structs for protobuf,
preparing for compatibility with Tendermint Core v0.34 ([#508])
- [tendermint/proto-compiler] A tendermint-proto-compiler crate was created that generates the tendermint-proto structs from the Tendermint Core Protobuf definitions.
- [testgen] Introduce the `testgen` crate for generating Tendermint types from
  minimal input ([#468])

### IMPROVEMENTS:

- [light-client] Use the `testgen` for generating tests
- [light-client] Use primary error as context of `NoWitnessLeft` error ([#477])
- [repo] Various improvements to documentation and crate structure
- [repo] Add CONTRIBUTING.md document ([#470])
- [specs] Updates to fork detection English spec for evidence handling in
  Tendermint and IBC ([#479])
- [specs] Model checking results and updates for the fast sync TLA+ spec ([#466])

### BUG FIXES:

- [light-client] Fix to reject headers from the future ([#474])

## v0.15.0

*July 17, 2020*

This release is the first official release of the revamped [light-client][light-client-dir] library and the [light-node][light-node-dir] command-line interface.
Together they provide a complete Tendermint light client implementation that performs squential and skipping verification
and attempts to detect forks across its peers. Complete TLA+ specifications for light client verification are included,
along with work-in-progress specs for fork detection. The implementation is compatible with v0.33 of Tendermint Core.

Note that both the [light-client][light-client-dir]  and [light-node][light-node-dir] crates are to be considered experimental software that will still undergo a 
lot of improvements and iterations. The goal of releasing an early version of our Light Client is to make it accessible, to get people use it, and to receive feedback.

An overview of the current design of the light client is provided in [ADR-006]
and [ADR-007].


 ⚠️ ️Deprecation warning ⚠️ : This might be the last release containing the [lite][lite-dir] module. Please take a look at the [light-client][light-client-dir] crate.

### BREAKING CHANGES:

- [repo] make secp256k1 dependency optional ([#441])

### FEATURES:

- [light-client] Rewrite and expansion of `lite`, the prior light client
  verification module, into a new fully-featured `light-client` crate. The crate provides a db, 
  functions for complete light client verification, peer management, fork detection, and evidence reporting,
  along with extensive testing. Components are composed via a `Supervisor`, which is run in its own thread, 
  and exposes a Handle trait to broker access to underlying state and
  functionality. See the [light-client][light-client-dir] crate for details.
- [light-node] New binary crate with CLI for running the light client as a daemon,
  complete with an rpc server for querying the latest state of the light node
  while it syncs with the blockchain. See the [light-node][light-node-dir] crate
  for details.

### BUG FIXES:

- [tendermint/validator] Sort validators by address on deserialization ([#410])
- [tendermint/validator] Fix deserializing Update struct when power field is 0
  ([#451])
- [tendermint/abci] Fix DeliverTx response deserialization issues with
  gasWanted, gasUsed, and data fields ([#432])
- [tendermint/lite_impl] Fix header.hash for height 1 ([#438])
