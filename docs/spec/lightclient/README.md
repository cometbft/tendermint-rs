# Light Client Specification

This directory contains work-in-progress English and TLA+ specifications for the Light Client
protocol. Implementations of the light client can be found in
[Rust](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/tree/master/light-client) and
[Go](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/tree/master/light).

Light clients are assumed to be initialized once from a trusted source 
with a trusted header and validator set. The light client
protocol allows a client to then securely update its trusted state by requesting and
verifying a minimal set of data from a network of full nodes (at least one of which is correct). 

The light client is decomposed into three components: 

- Commit Verification - verify signed headers and associated validator set changes from a single full node
- Fork Detection -  verify commits across multiple full nodes and detect conflicts (ie. the existence of forks)
- Fork Accountability - given a fork, which validators are responsible for it.

## Commit Verification

The [English specification](verification.md) describes the light client
commit verification problem in terms of the temporal properties
[LCV-DIST-SAFE.1](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/blob/master/docs/spec/lightclient/verification.md#lcv-dist-safe1) and 
[LCV-DIST-LIVE.1](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/blob/master/docs/spec/lightclient/verification.md#lcv-dist-live1). 
Commit verification is assumed to operate within the Tendermint Failure Model, where +2/3 of validators are correct for some time period and
validator sets can change arbitrarily at each height.

A light client protocol is also provided, including all checks that
need to be performed on headers, commits, and validator sets 
to satisfy the temporal properties - so a light client can continuously
synchronize with a blockchain. Clients can skip possibly
many intermediate headers by exploiting overlap in trusted and untrusted validator sets.
When there is not enough overlap, a bisection routine can be used to find a
minimal set of headers that do provide the required overlap.

The [TLA+ specification](Lightclient_A_1.tla) is a formal description of the
commit verification protocol executed by a client, including the safety and
liveness properties, which can be model checked with Apalache.

TODO: 
- more detail on TLA+?
- describe/cleanup the MC files 
- more detail on how to run the model checker
- some explanation about the experiments

## Fork Detection

This is a work-in-progress draft.

The [English specification](detection.md) defines blockchain forks and describes
the problem of a light client detecting them from communication with a network
of full nodes, where at least one is correct.

There is no TLA+ yet.

## Fork Accountability

There is no English specification yet. TODO: Jovan's work?

TODO: there is a WIP [TLA+
specification](https://github.com/informalsystems/verification/pull/13) in the
verification repo that should be moved over here.
